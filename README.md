## 01 - Mobile Login
This is a mobile login page concept that includes SVG logos, external font access. There are additional buttons. Mainly built with a trichromatic scheme with a login button with an accent color for UI.

## Inspiration
This is inspired by a clean, simple login page. Saw a similar concept on dribble [link](https://dribbble.com/shots/3829985-VNPAY-App-Interactions). I did not create the concept, I built off of it.

## Functionality
This is not a functionality site, this is just a front end HTML/CSS page with a little of angular for the icon library.

## Core concepts
1. Angular component
2. Angular/Font-Awesome integration\
